# Ez3D-Models-for-D-E-and-F-Motors

## The three models in this repository fly with the larger Estes motors. 

# Parts List:
1. Ez3D Fin Can based on the model desired 
2. Ez3D Nose Cone based on the model desired 
3. Ez3D Motor Retention Cap  24mm or 29mm
   - Print out the multiple sizes
   - Accounts for different printing tolerances and post flight shrinking
4. Ez3D Tube based launch rail guide or other launch pad support
   - rail guide
   - launch lug..
6. Eighteen (18) inches of body tube (this is usually the length they come in.
7. Four (4) feet of Kevlar string for Recovery Harness
   - Flight tested on 9KM DWLIFE Black Braided Kevlar Cord (1.3mm, 300 lb) but others may work
8. Parachute - 15 inch works fine
9. xxx inches of motor mounttype body tube (Optional)
    - This tube serves as an Insulator between the motor and Fin Can
    - Use of Insulator helps reduce Fin Can heat shrink after each launch
  

# Assembly: 

**NOTE: Individual printers and filiment have different tolerances** <br />
**- Fit check items before assembly and sand to fit if requried**
     
1. Tie Recovery Harness to hole in Fin Can
2. Thread Recovery Harness thru Body Tube
3. Slide Body Tube onto top of Fin Can
4. Tape Body Tube to Fin Can - avoid blocking integrated launch lug
5. Attach launch lugs or rails guide system
6. Tie loose end of Recovery Harness to Nose Cone
7. Tie streamer to Recovery Hanress near top of Nose Cone


# Launch Preperation:
1. Insert 1 or 2 squares of recovery wadding into Body Tube
2. Load Recovery Harness and Streamer into Body Tube
3. Place Nose Cone on top of Body Tube - ensure slightly snug fit
4. Slide motor insulator tube into Fin Can before motor (Optional)
5. Load motor into Fin Can
    - Motor will fit loosely if insulator is not used
    - Loose fit is not an issue with proper motor retention
7. Screw Motor Retention Cap onto base of Fin Can
   - Depending on your printer, the larger sizes may fit better
   - After a flight or two, the smaller size may fit better
9. Launch using standard model rocket procedures

# Recommended motors and expected performance: 

Ez3D Max

C11-3         = 300 ft  (Optimum delay = 3.5 s)???

D12-5         = 700 ft (Optimum delay = 5 s)???

Ez3D Max+

C11-3         = 300? ft  (Optimum delay = 3.5 s)???

D12-5         = 700 ft (Optimum delay = 5 s) ???

 -C11 and D12 require use of motor spacer

E12-6         = 1000 ft (Optimum delay = 5 s) ???

Ez3D Super Max

E16-6         = 950 ft  (Optimum delay = 5.5 s) ???

F15-6         = 1300 ft (Optimum delay = 5.8 s) ???


# IMPORTANT POST FLIGHT NOTES:
- 3D printed material shrinks after cooling down from heat of motor
- Removal of motor may be difficult or impossible after one or several flights
- The smaller motor retainer cap may fit better after the first flight
- If existing motor retainer caps no longer work, friction or tape may suffice for retention
- PLA filiment most suspectable to shrinking. Others may last longer.
