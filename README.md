# Ez3D-Models-for-D-E-and-F-Motors

## The three models in this repository fly with the larger Estes motors. 

Instead of writing detailed instruction for these models, I will just highlight 
some of the differences between then and the smaller ones. 

# Assembly: 

**NOTE: Individual printers and filiment have different tolerances** <br />
**- Fit check items before assembly and sand to fit if requried**
     
1. I use plastic rivets instead of tape to secure the Body Tube to the Fin Can
 - Also consider wrapping tape around the joint for a better seal (for ejection charge force)
2. Since these are heavier models, I use large launch lugs and rail buttons.

# Launch Preperation:
1. Just like the others. 

# Recommended motors and expected performance: 

Ez3D Max

C11-3         = 300 ft  (Optimum delay = 3.5 s)???

D12-5         = 700 ft (Optimum delay = 5 s)???

Ez3D Max+

C11-3         = 300? ft  (Optimum delay = 3.5 s)???

D12-5         = 700 ft (Optimum delay = 5 s) ???

 -C11 and D12 require use of motor spacer

E12-6         = 1000 ft (Optimum delay = 5 s) ???

Ez3D Super Max

E16-6         = 950 ft  (Optimum delay = 5.5 s) ???

F15-6         = 1300 ft (Optimum delay = 5.8 s) ???


# IMPORTANT POST FLIGHT NOTES:
- 3D printed material shrinks after cooling down from heat of motor
- Removal of motor may be difficult or impossible after one or several flights
- The smaller motor retainer cap may fit better after the first flight
- If existing motor retainer caps no longer work, friction or tape may suffice for retention
- PLA filiment most suspectable to shrinking. Others may last longer.
